        Using Morrstar's data features described on the main page, our team utilized two independently 
        developed models: one which leverages a machine-learning approach and the other which makes use of a statistical modeling aproach.
        These models were then each utilized to find the the states which would most benefit from the opening of a Star House.
        The results of each of these models can be seen below:

        From there, utilized this data to find the geograpical locations within these states at which a Star House would best aid the population.
        Knowing that optimal locations would be in large cities, we selected the closest metro areas to our discovered locations. Leveraging the data
        from our two models against one another, we found that both approaches discovered that the most optimal locations for a Star House are:
